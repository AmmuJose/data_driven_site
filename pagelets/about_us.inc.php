 <div class= "pgh1">
        Garroway Restaurant, with a capacity of 800 seats, was established by the Himmel Family in 2000. 
 		   We seek to delight with little pleasures, such as remembered names and constant courtesies. We strive to build trust that we will 
 		   deliver in any situation requiring judgment and discretion. With attention to even the smallest details, and unsolicited words of encouragement, 
		   we work hard to create a certain magic around Garroway. Our passion is hospitality, 
			 over the top performance and creating a legacy of greatness that endures and prospers for generations.</div>
